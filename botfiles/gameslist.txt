// every line which does not contain 4 times the sign "#" will be ignored

// every line represents a game, with the format
// #[command name]#[permission group]#[Game Title Prefix]# , the rest of the line will be ignored
// about [command name]: this should only contain numbers and letters
// the settings should be written in a file named [command name]_settings.txt
// NOTE: if there is no such a file, some default settings will be used.
// about [permission group]: right now you have the choices to write "all", "admin", or "huscalive" here.
//         "admin" means bbc admin, "huscalive" means people that are alive in the current husc season(s), "all" are all players
// about [Game Title Prefix]: this is the beginning of the game name, the rest should be from the creator


// ok, here are some examples, if you want, you can add more of them.
